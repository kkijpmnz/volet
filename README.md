# How About Advcash (Volet) Card? Introduction and Review

## Advcash (Volet) Introduction

Advcash (Volet) has reintroduced its physical card, but it comes at a high cost. Initially, when I registered with Advcash (Volet), I could apply for the physical card. However, the service was later suspended for a long period. Recently, they have started offering the card again, but it is much more expensive than before.

I do not recommend applying for this physical card due to the following costs:

- **Card issuance fee**: $120
- **Recharge fee**: 2.95%
- **Monthly management fee**: $9.95 or $99/year
- **ATM withdrawal fee**: 2% + 1%
- **Currency exchange fee**: 2%

For example, if you withdraw cash at an ATM in mainland China, the total cost will exceed 6%! The card is valid for three years, with a maximum annual withdrawal limit of $500,000 and a maximum card balance of $100,000.
